#  Align Relevant Skills

Prior to conceptualizing your new website, it is important to first audit your relevant prerequisite skills — namely, those rooted in web development and coding. Such skills can be instrumental in DIY site creation, as they can help you handle crucial technical phases autonomously which may allow for a smoother development process and easier creative control.
Helpful website development prerequisites may include coding in languages like JavaScript and HTML/CSS (for various design and usability factors)

The Main Focus for the project are:

+ Semantic HTML
+ Using appropriate tags that fits each role
+ Headings tags
+ Paragraph tags
+ Lists tags
 Responsive design
+ CSS Media Queries
+ relative units
easy-to-read typography and font sizes
Custom Domain and DNS Configuration
+ Using custom domain previously bought from domestic registrar "Niagahoster"
+ Connecting and Managing custom domain with "Cloudfare"
+ Deploying site through "Netlify" and connecting custom domain with Netlify's subdomain
Technical Writing
+ Proficiency in 'Technical Writing' to create clear and concise documentation.

# Choose a Hosting Provider
Choosing a hosting provider is a relatively easy, but crucial part of website creation. Many leading hosting platforms (such as niagahoster ) have expedited this process, often providing complimentary domain registration, discounted website building tools and other perks for first-time registrations.

As in the previous step, this decision should be rooted in your needs and goals for the site — especially those related to site structure and usability. For example, if the site is intended to showcase image galleries and multimedia, you will likely want to pick a platform allowing space for larger files and adequate speed. Using such criteria, you’ll be able to narrow your options down to a few promising providers and determine which will be the most cost-effective, reliable and in tune with your company’s aspirations.
